            A camel (from: Latin: camelus and Greek: κάμηλος (kamēlos) from
            Semitic: gāmāl.[7][8]) is an even-toed ungulate in the genus Camelus
            that bears distinctive fatty deposits known as "humps" on its back.
            Camels have long been domesticated and, as livestock, they provide
            food (milk and meat) and textiles (fiber and felt from hair).

          <p class="slider__text">
            Camels do not directly store water in their humps; they are
            reservoirs of fatty tissue. When this tissue is metabolized, it
            yields more than one gram of water for every gram of fat processed.
            This fat metabolization, while releasing energy, causes water to
            evaporate from the lungs during respiration (as oxygen is required
            for the metabolic process): overall, there is a net decrease in
            water.

            Like horses, camels originated in North America and eventually
            spread across Beringia to Asia. They survived in the Old World, and
            eventually humans domesticated them and spread them globally. Along
            with many other megafauna in North America, the original wild camels
            were wiped out during the spread of the first indigenous peoples of
            the Americas from Asia into North America, 10 to 12,000 years ago.
